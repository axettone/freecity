Map

The map is an abstraction of a real map, and has nothing to do with the graphic
map.

The "map" structure is located into map.h, and it's pretty straightforward
(height, width, items).

This design makes possible to access directly to map_item structures, who are
generic pointers to actual buildings and things.
