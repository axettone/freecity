How does the main loop work?

The simulation starts at EPOCH (time_t = 0) that corresponds to 1/1/1970. This
date is very important in the IT world and it's full of meanings.

The current time is stored inside the city structure (the_time). The time is
set to 0 at the beginning ad it's increased during the simulation.

On each simulation loop, the simulator does:

1) evaluate economy attractiveness
2) make people migrations (in/out)
3) check power and water grids (integrity, consumption, costs)
4) evaluate economy
5) gather taxes
6) apply ordinances
7) evaluate government (hospitals, schools, ...)
8) autosave
9) update date

Every day has 24*60*60=86400 seconds, so we add 86400 to the city time on
every loop. This makes possible to use gmtime() and strftime() to convert
the time_t counter to an actual date by using standard c functions (defined
into time.h).
