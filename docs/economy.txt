Economy model (draft)

I'm not an economist, and I'd like to receive feedbacks and contributions from
people who are competent. In the meantime, this is the draft of my economic
model, that the simulator uses to track attractiveness of the city.

# Segments of population/jobs
This is a classic approach: low, medium and high levels of wealth are used to
distinguish tax rates and behaviours.
Wealth

LOW	MEDIUM	HIGH
0-40	40-75	75-100

Maximum tolerable tax rate is 60%, minimum is 0%.

Rich people want to work in high wealth companies, so you get the point.

People choose to live in your city if tax rate is ok, and there's the right
place to live in.

This is the main formula, applied for each residential building.

TAX_RATE
The tax rate for this segment (e.g. medium wealth)

MAX_TAX_RATE (=60)
Self explained

AVAILABLE_HOMES
How many homes are available in this building

AVAILABLE_JOBS
How many jobs in the same segment are available

ACTIVE_JOBS
Total count of people having a job in this segment

TOTAL_JOBS
Available jobs+Active jobs

CHOOSINESS
%of compatible jobs refused by people

DISTANCE
Medium distance from the building to the AVAILABLE_JOBS.

MAX_DISTANCE (=100)
Maximum distance people want to travel for commuting.
I have several doubts on this.

LAND_VALUE
The land value of the building. Too low or to high is not a good deal.

Each parameter has a weight, that can be different for any segment. In the
following formula I'm using fixed weight, but they will probably change in
the future, e.g. CHOOSINESS should be higher for high-wealth people, and lower
for low-wealth people.

The formula is this:

0.30*((MAX_TAX_RATE-TAX_RATE)/MAX_TAX_RATE)
+
0.50*CHOOSINESS*(AVAILABLE_JOBS/TOTAL_JOBS)
+
0.10*DISTANCE/MAX_DISTANCE
+
0.10*(50-ABS(50-LAND_VALUE)) //ABS = absolute value
