# freecity
An open source city simulator, inspired by Simcity.

## Requirements
gcc

## Compile & run
$ make

$ ./freecity

## Main goal

I'd like to create a good city simulator, not only as a game. The program should simulate the dynamics of a city as an enviroinment: people, jobs, companies and the economy in general.

## Development status

For now the simulator is in a beginning stage. I'm working on the basic structures, data types and other basic stuff.

I'm using the main() function to test the routines. My idea is to implement a main loop: on every iteration the simulatore does the calculation and the consequent repopulation of data structures.

## Graphics

For now no graphics is provided: I'm just working on the simulator only. Any help or collaboration on the simulator and/or the graphics is encouraged.
