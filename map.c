 * Put an item (e.g. a building like a school) on the map. The target position
 * on map is described by (x,y) coordinates. The size of the building is
 * side_size^2 blocks on the map. The building is encapsulated into a map_item
 * structure, and it will be pointed from each block on the map.
 * If any target block of the map is already occupied by something else,
 * a MAP_POS_OCC is returned. If you're trying to put the item on the border
 * of the map and there's no enough space, MAP_POS_OCC is returned. If 
 * everything was ok, MAP_POS_OK is returned.
